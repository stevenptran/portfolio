After graduating college, I realized I didn't have a portfolio website yet. I decided to use a template. This is the first project for the Headstarter program.

## What is Headstarter?

Headstarter is all about creating the ultimate community for software engineers by giving future tech leaders clear direction, consistency, and transparency. They came up with a Career Capital score (0-100) to help people stand out in the job market. Unlike Udemy or YouTube, Headstarter offers something special: a real community and genuine feedback. This includes meetups, team settings, and a network of engineers at different levels. Their approach is to start with a problem or vision, learn the necessary tech stacks with friends, and keep iterating, with learning happening naturally along the way.

## This website

This website will not stay up for long. This is just a template to submit for my first project for Headstarter. I eventually want to make a more visually appealing website and make it more personalized.

## Why I decided to do Headstarter

My friend Steven referred me to this program and asked me to join. However, I am a full-time software engineer at Dell Technologies. I heard Headstarter had a 20 hour/week time commitment which sounded like a bit too much. However, I liked the vision of Headstarter and found this to be a very good opportunity to develop my skillset. I decided to commit some time to accomplish this.
